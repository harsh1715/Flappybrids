The Next Screen will prompt you to choose the difficulity you would like to do. Between Easy Mode and Hard Mode<br>

#### Remember!

You must control the bird and time it so that it clears the gap between the top and the bottom pipes. 

If you let the bird hit the window boundaries (top or bottom) or you end up running into the pipes, it will be game over and you will be propmted to Play Again, then able to switch your difficulity. 

### Easy Mode
To select Easy Mode, click the button on the screen.

In Easy Mode. You will encounter something similar to the classic game of Flappy Birds. With randomly spaced gap sizes and fixed pipe positions. This allows for a predictable and manageable challenge for players. 


### Hard Mode
To select Hard Mode, click the button on the screen.

The Hard mode enhances the functionality of the Easy mode by introducing vertical movement to the pipes and dynamically adjusting the gap size between them. 

### Note
Gameplay is a lot more smoother than it seems on the Gifs
