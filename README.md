    2) Your goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible without colliding with them.

    3) Each successful pass through a pair of pipes earns you one point.

    4) Be cautious! If the bird touches the sky, ground or the pipes, the game is over.

    5) Easy Mode features pipes with randomly spaced gaps, providing a simpler gameplay experience. 

    6) If you choose hard mode, the pipes dynamically move up and down, altering the gaps between them, offering a more challenging gameplay.

The Next Screen will prompt you to choose the difficulity you would like to do. Between Easy Mode and Hard Mode<br>

#### Remember!

You must control the bird and time it so that it clears the gap between the top and the bottom pipes.
